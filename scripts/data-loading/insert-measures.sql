Keno is a "game where a player purchases a ticket from a field of 80 numbers and selects a specific amount of numbers." A random number generator chooses 20 numbers at random to determine a match against the selected numbers. A drawing occurs every five minutes daily. When this legislation was passed in 2017, cities and towns were required to authorize the operation of keno within the municipality before it could be offered. The City of Concord placed a question on the ballot relating to the authorization of keno in November 2017 which did not pass. Accordingly, keno has not been operated in the City. The State recently amended RSA 284:51 which now states that keno is authorized unless the city or town votes to prohibit the operation of the game.
Should the majority of voters vote yes to the question, the City will inform the Lottery Commission that the game has been prohibited in the City and no keno licenses may be issued to retailers within the City of Concord.
Should the majority of voters vote no to the question, lottery retailers in the City will be eligible to receive a keno license and operate the game beginning on June 1, 2027.
